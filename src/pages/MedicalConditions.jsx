    causes: "Acne develops when pores clog with oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria, causing inflammation. Whiteheads occur when pores are fully blocked, while blackheads form when clogged pores remain open and darken on exposure to air. Excess oil and inflammation can lead to deeper cysts and nodules. Causes include hormonal, genetic, and environmental factors. Androgens, which rise during puberty, menstruation, and pregnancy, increase oil production. Family history, comedogenic products, certain medications, diet, and stress can also trigger acne.",

Diagnosis is usually made by visual examination.",
    treatment: "Treatment may involve a minor procedure to remove trapped pus, and in more serious or recurring cases, medication may be prescribed to control the infection.",
    causes: "Boils originate due to the rapid buildup of pus caused by a bacterial infection in hair follicles under the skin. As excessive amounts of pus fill the small bumps, the growth becomes larger and more painful, eventually leading to its own rupture and drainage.",
